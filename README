NAME

    CGI::Thin - A very lightweight Parser for CGI Forms

SYNOPSIS

      use CGI::Thin;
      use strict;
      
      my %cgi_data = &Parse_CGI ();

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a very lightweight parser of CGI forms.  And it has a 
    special feature that it will return an array if the same key is used
    twice in the form.  And you can force an array to avoid complications.

    The hash %cgi_data will have all the form data from either a POST or GET form
    and will also work for "multipart/form-data" forms necessary for uploading files.

USAGE

  Functions

    * `CGI::Thin::Parse_CGI(@keys)'
        The optional @keys will be used to force arrays to be returned.

        The function also has special features for getting multiple values for a
        single form key.  For example if we have this form...

          <input type="checkbox" name="color" value="red">red
          <input type="checkbox" name="color" value="green">green
          <input type="checkbox" name="color" value="blue">blue

        One of three things can happen.

        1)  The user does not select any color.
            So $cgi_data{'color'} will not exist.
        2)  The user selects exactly one color.
            So $cgi_data{'color'} will be the scalar value selected.
        3)  The user selects exactly more than one color.
            So $cgi_data{'color'} will be a reference to an array of the values selected.

        To fix this you could call the parser by giving it a list of keys that you want
        to force to be arrays.  In this case like...

          use CGI::Thin;
          my %cgi_data = &Parse_CGI ('color');

        Now it they pick exactly one color, $cgi_data{'color'} will be a reference to
        an array of the one value selected.  And thus there will be no need for
        special cases later in the code.
